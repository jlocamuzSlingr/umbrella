Goal: The goal is to provide the company's clients with an easy and fast way to access their information and communicate with their agents.

Technology: To achieve this goal, Flutter Flow was used as a web-based platform. Flutter Flow allows developers to create and deploy mobile and web applications quickly and easily using a visual drag-and-drop interface.

User features: The mobile app is designed for company customers. It provides a platform for customers to view their policies' status and all the relevant information regarding their policies and coverages. Customers can also use the app to communicate with their agents.
