In addition, we developed a highly functional Platform App using Slingr, which allowed us to centralize all the business data and automate complex workflows. This was further enhanced by the integration of a notification system via endpoints. Furthermore, we developed a user-friendly Mobile App using Flutterflow to provide easy access to certain features for our users.
